Dear Friends and Family,

It is that time of year again? Christmas is here upon us. I know that it is easy to get wrapped up in buying gifts, sending Christmas cards, and visiting loved ones. I wonder how many of us actually stop for a minute and think about what we really are celebrating.

Is it Santa Claus? Time off work and the opportunity to be with family? Exchanging gifts? Being charitable?
 
 I don't believe any of these really get to the center of the holiday. Calling Christmas Jesus' birthday doesn't even do it justice. No, Christmas is a lot more than a birthday party. It is, in fact, a celebration of God's intervention in human history.

From the moment of Adam's sin, the Scriptures outline God's relentless pursuit of man to restore the broken fellowship. Through Mary's virgin birth, Jesus, Son of God, became a man. He came to dwell among us. He walked in our shoes. He experienced all of our joys and pains.

Jesus became a man to become the vehicle through which God could bring mankind back into fellowship with Him. He paid the price that we never could.

This year, we all got a dose of reality on September 11. Our lives are finite and could end in a moment's notice. I would encourage each of you to spend some time thinking about Jesus and what he means to you.

We hope that you have a wonderful Christmas and a fabulous New Year.  
Thanks for being a part of our lives.

Love in Christ,
Eric, Shannon, and Emma Wallace
