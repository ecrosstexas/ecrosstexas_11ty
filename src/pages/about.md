ecrosstexas.com is the personal website of [Eric Wallace](/eric/).  

As things often do, it didn't start out that way. Back in late 2001, I had the idea to create a Slashdot-like site for Texas.  This is from my original about page back then:

> ecrosstexas is a community [weblog](/weblog/) (aka blog) about life in the great state of Texas. The site is a place for each of us to gather and discuss our lives; talk about the stories of the day; and to guide each other to the best of the Internet. Yes, this site does focus heavily on Texas and Texans, but we are not exclusionary. Borrowing from the bumper sticker, _I wasn't born in Texas, but I got here as fast as I could_. In a way, we are like [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org/) focused on Texas.

Back then, "the texas blog" was the tag line for ecrosstexas.
