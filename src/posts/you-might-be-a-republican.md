Arnold Schwarzenegger:

> If you believe that government should be accountable to the people, not the people to the government...then you are a Republican! If you believe a person should be treated as an individual, not as a member of an interest group...then you are a Republican! If you believe your family knows how to spend your money better than the government does...then you are a Republican! If you believe our educational system should be held accountable for the progress of our children...then you are a Republican! If you believe this country, not the United Nations, is the best hope of democracy in the world...then you are a Republican! And, ladies and gentlemen...if you believe we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism...then you are a Republican!
