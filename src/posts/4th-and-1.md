You would have thought that the Giants saw the game film from the [Cowboys](http://www.dallascowboys.com/) [31-27 loss](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=221208006 "Garcia, Owens get it done against Cowboys") to the 49ers back on Dec 8. Espcially considering the Giants played that Cowboys the following week. Remember the 4th and 1 decision with less than 3 minutes to go? Convert and win the game or kick a field goal and hope to hold on. Campo decided to kick, Cundiff misses and the 49ers drive down the field to score the winning touchdown.

The [Giants](http://www.giants.com/) faced the same decision today in losing to the 49ers, [39 to 38](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recapPlayoff2002?gameId=230105025 "Failed kicks down stretch sink Giants"). 4th and 1 with less than 3 minutes left in the game. Again, the decision is made to kick. Same results. [Matt Bryant](http://www.giants.com/team/playerpage.cfm?player_id=46823) misses the field goal and the 49ers drive down the field to score the game winning touchdown.

The Giants final chance to win the game with 6 secords left went down the tubes when the snapper and holder blew any shot for a winning field goal. He should have known it was 3rd down. Just spike the ball and re-kick!

One more thing, when will someone shut [T.O.](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/players/profile?statsId=3664 "Terrell Owens") up for good? Isn't their any team that can shut him down on the field?
