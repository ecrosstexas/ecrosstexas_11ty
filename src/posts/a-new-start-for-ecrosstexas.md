After almost a year since I pulled down my hacked [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) site.  I am committing to get this site back up and running.  For years I've been playing with and learning [Django](https://djangoproject.com/).  It's a great tool, but I don't really have the time to devote to developing and running a full-stack site in Django.

I've seen many sites built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com), and other [static site generators](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/). They always looked appealing and reminded me of the simplicity of [Movable Type](https://movabletype.org) which I used once upon a time in the past until it would bring my shared hosting site to a near standstill when reubuilding the site.  Somewhere along the line in the past year I discovered [Jamstack](https://github.com/automata/awesome-jamstack). 

I watched several videos on YouTube covering Jamstack and started playing with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) since it seemed to be getting so much traction. Speed, security, and plugins galore. I know I'm a bit slow and I don't know a ton of JavaScript, but oh man it seems so complicated!  I drove my crazy I couldn't easily inspect the code served up with the dev server.

As I kept looking into Jamstack, I eventually stumbled upon [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev). I believe I have found a home! This "simpler static site generator" is a thing of beauty.  I've played around with a couple of tutorials and then took the plunge and bought Andy Bell's awesome new tutorial [Learn Eleventy From Scratch](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/). Right now this site is 100% tutorial, but my plan is change and evolve right before your eyes over the coming weeks.

Most importantly, I plan to start writing regularly again!
