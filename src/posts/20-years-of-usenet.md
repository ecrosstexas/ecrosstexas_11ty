[Google](http://www.google.com/ "search") has [announced](http://www.google.com/googlegroups/archive_announce_20.html "google") today that its entire 20 year archive of USENET messages (more than 700 million messages) is now available online with [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/ "google"). And who says you can run from your past!

On [Paul Boutin's](http://paulboutin.weblogger.com/) site I ran across a Wired [story](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.05/mustread.html?pg=1 "wired.com:") about the process of making this archive available.
