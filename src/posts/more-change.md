In the course of 13 months, *the texas blog* has now changed blog engines four times.

1.  [phpWebSite](http://phpwebsite.appstate.edu/)
2.  [b2](http://www.cafelog.com/)
3.  [pMachine](http://www.pmachine.com/)
4.  [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/)

I think I will stay with Movable Type for good. It has so much power, it is kind of intimidating. MT looks to be the tool of choice for [serious users](http://diveintomark.org/ "Dive into Mark"). I have most entries and comments imported, but there is still some work to do.

I am having a huge problem with the archive by category feature. The rebuild process fails at this point every time.

`Writing to '/home/***/public_html/blog/archives/' failed: Opening local file '/home/***/public_html/blog/archives/' failed: Is a directory`
